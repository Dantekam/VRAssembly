## Team
John B. and Kian M.

## VR Assembly
The project contains two sets, one containing a house which has 15 pieces.
The other set containing a pathway and environmental decor; containing 18 pieces.



## Bonus 1: At Least 15 parts
The sets contain 15 parts and 18 parts respectively, fullfilling this requirement.

## Bonus 3: Add two assembly objects
When the first assembly object (e.g. the house) is completed, the second set of assembly objects is able to be seen as they are enabled and able to be interacted with to complete.
