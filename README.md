## VR Assembly
The project contains two sets, one containing a house which has 15 pieces.
The other set containing a pathway and environmental decor; containing 18 pieces.

### Goal Pieces Look Hollow and the current one will have a blue transparent affect instead of the original defaulted color.

### Block pieces are the grabbable kind and these are opaque, in similarity to goal pieces the current one will be highlighted cyan indicating that one must be connected to its' goal counterpart.

## Bonus 1: At Least 15 parts
The sets contain 15 parts and 18 parts respectively, fullfilling this requirement.

## Bonus 3: Add two assembly objects
When the first assembly object (e.g. the house) is completed, the second set of assembly objects is able to be seen as they are enabled and able to be interacted with to complete.
